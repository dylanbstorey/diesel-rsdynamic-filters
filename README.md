# Examples of dynamic filtering with [diesel-rs](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel)

First - this repo is **HEAVILY** based on the examples in [diesel-rs-dynamic-filters](https://github.com/andreievg/diesel-rs-dynamic-filters), and by "heavily" I mean - its all their work, i just needed to restructure it to make it fit how I think about the software architectures I tend to build. So thank you Andrei for the original work!
